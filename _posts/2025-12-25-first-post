This is my first blog post on this site. I don't know if I want to make a blog, but this is just what the default GitHub tutorial does. My vision for this site is to host a portfolio (which I guess I could do with blog posts) and to also have some sort of interface for my own use. Now that I think about it, GitHub pages is for static sites, so I may need to do something different for the interface part of this. This is some extra text.
